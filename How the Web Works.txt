Part One: Terminology

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and it is how browsers and servers communicate.

A URL is a Universal Resource Locator.

DNS stands for Domain Name System and is like a big phone book for the web.

A query string provides extra information like search terms and form info

HTTP verbs include GET, Post, and DELETE.

HTTP responses indicate whether a resquest has been successfully completed.Examples include 404 Not Found, 200 OK, 500 Internal Server Error. 


Request headers could be the hostname youre asking about, language your browser wants information in, cookies the server sent and more.

Response headers could be the content type, cookies the server wants to set, caching info and more.


***http://site.com/some/page.html?x=1***

means

- Turn “site.com” into `123.45.67.89`
- Connect to `123.45.67.89`
- On port 80 (the default)
- Using the HTTP protocol
- Ask for ***/some/page.html***
